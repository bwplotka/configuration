# Guestbook Example

This example is show as an official Kubernetes tutorial:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/

Hence, we think it's a good candidate to make for a basic example.

All implementations of the example should showcase the ability to:

* change the namespace we deploy the application to
* change the amount of replicas of Deployments
* define labels per Deployment once (or even once in general) and pass them through the various occurances respectively
